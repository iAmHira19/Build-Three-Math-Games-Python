# Build-Three-Math-Games-Python# Math Games in Python

This repository contains three interactive math games created using Python. The games are designed to help users practice various mathematical concepts through engaging and interactive methods.

## Games Included

1. **Scatter Plot Game**
   - **Description**: Randomly generates points on a graph. The player has to input the (x, y) coordinates of these points.
   - **Features**: 
     - Generates a scatter plot with random points.
     - Allows users to guess coordinates.

2. **Algebra Practice Game**
   - **Description**: Generates one-step and two-step algebra problems with random integer values. The player has to solve these problems and input their answers.
   - **Features**:
     - Generates random algebra problems.
     - Allows users to input answers and provides feedback on correctness.

3. **Projectile Game**
   - **Description**: Displays a "wall" with random height and location. The player uses sliders to adjust a parabolic path to clear the wall. There is also a second level where users enter coefficients manually.
   - **Features**:
     - Interactive sliders to adjust projectile path.
     - Manual entry of coefficients for advanced difficulty.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/math-games-python.git
